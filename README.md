#  Motivation

This template was designed to help HBC team members use consistent styling across apps that we develop. The CSS file underpining it is a living document and will likely need to undergo revisions as we change color schemes and also as we incorporate new input and outputs into our apps.

# How to use this template

The `app.R` file has a skeleton of a R Shiny app in it with everything need to visualize the header logo and CSS styling file. 

What you will need to do to use this template:

**1)** Download `app.R` and start an R Project in R Studio.

**2)** Create a `www` directory in your working directory.

**3)** Download `HBC_logo.png` and `style.css` and place them in your `www` directory.
